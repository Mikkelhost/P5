# P5
5th semester project at Aalborg University Electronics and IT.
This repository holds all the software and schematics/PCB layouts used in the project.
More specifically here is what is in this repo:
- Psoc project which is the brain in the system itself.
- Arduino code for the Arduino Nano which programs the 13 registers of a Local Oscillator circuit(ADF4355-3).
- some different matlab scripts used for calculating antenna, control and other system parameters.

# What can the system do?
The system can detect and track a 2.4-2.483 GHz signal coming from a beacon. It can track the beacon in both the horizontal axis and the vertical axis and turn 360 degrees around itself with the help from a slipring.
A video of the test of acceptance can be seen at the following youtube link: https://youtu.be/UUuUL_128io
